# Raw 16S data batch folders
All samples were sent to Eurofins for amplicon sequencing. DADA2 is best run separately on each sequencing batch, so instrument_run numbers were extracted from fastq headers, indicating that the samples had been distributed across three separate runs.

Raw data files obtained from the ENA should be grouped into these three folders. The batch number of each sample is listed in the main metadata file.
